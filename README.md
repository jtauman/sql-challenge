# sql-challenge

In this challenge, Data Engineering and Data Analysis tasks were performed on HR data from a fictional company.  All data, database schema, and database queries are located in the EmployeeSQL folder.

## Data Engineering

An PostgreSQL database was generated to accommodate the data from the 6 csv files provided for the challenge (see challenge_ERD.png and employee_db_schema.sql for database schema).

## Data Analysis

The PostgreSQL database was queried to accomplish 8 tasks provided for the challenge, such as: "List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name."  The code for the queries is listed in query.sql.

Bonus analysis is located in the Employees_SQL/bonus.
